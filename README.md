# Fall_2021_CIS30E_Project

The purpose of the project was to create a web scraper to gather information on a website. I picked YouTube with the intent to search for certain videos by content creator to form a list of videos organizing it by name, title of video, date of upload, and link of video. If possible with the list of links to download the videos to the computer to watch.

I barely started on the project and did not allocate enough time to accomplish the project. The issue was not time but effort and energy that I needed to put toward the project.
